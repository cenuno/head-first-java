## Managing Java Versions

This repo uses [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/usage) to handle Java versions.

### Install instructions

To install, please [follow these instructions](https://sdkman.io/install). When I run `sdk version`, here's what I see:

```text
SDKMAN!
script: 5.18.2
native: 0.4.3
```


Afterwards, install this project's version of Java by running this command.

```bash
# download the exact version needed from the .sdkmanrc file
sdk env install
```
